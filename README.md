### Hi there, I'm Charles 👋

Nice to meet you! I'm a software developer, originally from Beirut, Lebanon and currently residing in Montreal, Canada. I love writing code and building projects that I am truly interested in either for fun or because they can help automate something in my daily workflow👨🏻‍💻. I am currently a Computer Science student at Concordia University, and will be graduating in Summer 2020.

In my free time, I am either learning new things (I am absolutely fascinated by Artificial Intelligence), or I'm enjoying life with friends (before COVID-19 happened) 👀.<br>

- 📫 How to reach me: charlesabouhaidar@pm.me.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Graphics and Differential Equations while doing an internship at Hydro-Quebec.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can fluently speak, write, read and understand English, French and Arabic. I am also learning Spanish! 🇪🇸
